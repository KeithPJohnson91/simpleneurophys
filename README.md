# Simple Neurophysiology
# Chat-GPT wrote this

Welcome to the source code repository for simpleneurophys.com, an interactive, real-time neurophysiology simulation tool. 

## Features

- Real-time simulations of common neuron models, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy experimentation.
- No downloads required - all simulations are run directly in the browser.
- Current simulations available:
  - Passive membrane simulation (RC-circuit)
  - Spiking Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron simulation
  - Voltage-clamp of a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron
  - More and more elaborate on the way as I have time
- If you find errors or have ideas, please email me: keithpjohnson91@gmail.com


## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/keithpjohnson91/simpleneurophys.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Deployment

This app is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and can be easily deployed to any static file host, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). simpleneurophys.com is hosted on AWS Amplify.
